Jenny is a computational biology research scientist. She has genomes of species she studies and wants to visualize them as graphs to understand relationships between genes in the genome. She values ease of use and wants to be able to quickly generate output. Jenny has a technical background in the field but does not want to spend much time programming or editing code.

Kevin is a graduate student in bioinformatics conducting computational analyses on genomic data. He wants to process, visualize and interpret the  large data sets to uncover the meaningful patterns. He needs a reproducible tool to integrate data analysis, visualization and biology interpretation. He has intermediate programming skills and stats skills with strong biological knowledge but prefers a clear, well-documented workflow.

Ken is the PI of a genomics lab. He wants to quickly visualize the genes that make up a genome and the relationship between the genes for an upcoming presentation. He does not have a background in computational biology. Ken wants something quick and easy to manipulate. Ken’s job does not require technical skill but requires a deep understanding of the underlying biology and big picture understanding of the lab’s goals and ideas. 
Lucy is a genomics researcher. She wants to discover novel relationships between genes in genomes of various bacterial species with graph neural networks. To do this, she needs her genomic data to be formatted in graphs that can be processed by a graph neural network. She has strong programming skills but wants to avoid spending a lot of her time wrangling data.

Megan is an intern in a research lab assisting with data analysis projects. She wants to learn analytical workflow and contribute to data processing, visualization, and basic interpretation tasks. She needs clear instructions and accessible tools that help her understand the data pipeline. She has beginner-to-intermediate technical skills and is still gaining confidence with coding and analytical tools.

Jeff is a science enthusiast interested in understanding how genes relate across species. He would like to explore an interactive demo that visually shows how genes from different bacteria cluster by function. He values a simple, visually engaging interface with clear explanations and interactive features to make complex data easy to grasp. He has minimal technical or biological background and relies on intuitive visuals rather than code or advanced analysis.

Ophelia is a scientist at a disease-control center tracking infectious-disease genomes. She needs to visualize genetic similarities and mutations across viral samples (such as COVID-19 strains) to identify emerging variants. A reliable, scalable and real-time tool is helpful for her to integrate new genomic data, highlight clusters of concern, and support outbreak response decisions. She owns moderate technical and biological expertise.

Tony is a global health researcher at the World Health Organization monitoring pathogen evolution worldwide. He needs to compare genomic data from multiple countries to detect emerging variants, track mutation patterns, and assess potential global health risks. He would like to have a secure and globally integrated visualization tool that provides clear, real-time insights to support data-driven policy. He has strong epidemiological expertise and some data -analysis experience.
