Jeff, Public interactive demo
Jeff wishes to explore gene-function clusters interactively to understand how genes relate across species, even without coding or biology expertise.

Ophelia, Real-time variant monitoring dashboard
Ophelia tracks infectious-disease genome evolution and needs real-time visual analytics to detect emerging variants.

Tony, Global comparative genomics
Tony monitors pathogen evolution across countries and compares genomic data to support global health policy decisions.

Mike, Educational notebook launcher
Mike wants to teach graph learning concepts using real bacterial genomes in a reproducible, student-friendly environment.

Alexandra, Web visualization connector
Alexandra integrates scientific graphs into interactive dashboards for non-technical audiences. She requires exportable data formats compatible with front-end frameworks.

Nancy, Cloud pipeline & API integration
Nancy develops production-scale genomic pipelines for biotech. She needs modular APIs and scalable execution across cloud environments.

Ken, Uses web visualization
Ken visualizes relationships between genes and genomes for presentations and writing grants. He needs high-quality images in a low-barrier way.

Ben, Uses the GraphMAE
Ben uses the graph masked autoencoder to discern the necessary elements of the bacterial genome he is working on. He types in the name of the bacteria and receives as an output the graph representation of the genome. 

Jen, Uses visualization
Sequenced the genome of a novel bacteria discovered in the soil of the Hoh rainforest. Uses MGL to find similar genomes in the database. 

Tom, 
Uses the synthetic biology toolset to add a new protein into an existing bacterial genome.
